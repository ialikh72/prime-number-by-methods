# Prime Number Checker (C#)

This is a simple C# console program that checks whether a given number is a prime number or not using a method.

## What the Program Does
- Takes a number from the user
- Checks if the number is prime
- Prints whether the number is prime or not

## How It Works
The program uses a method called `isprime(int n)` which:
- Returns `false` if the number is less than or equal to 1  
- Checks divisibility from 2 to n/2  
- Returns `true` if no divisor is found
